## Disassembly

While not the easiest device to open up, it is possible to disassemble the CGG1 with minimal to no damage.

1. Gently heat the front lens of the device to soften the blue holding it to the body.
2. After the glue has been softened, use a razor blade (or possibly a guitar pick) to 'slice' the glue the holding the lens to the rest of the body. **Note**: be very careful to not to damage the E Ink screen.
3. After the lens has been removed, carefully slice any remaining glue between the rear and front clamshell. Once this glue has been cut through, a metal spludger can be used to release the 8 plastic clips holding the body together. **Note**: be careful to not damage the flat flex cables at the top/bottom of the case.
4. The PCB is adhered to the reverse side of the front clamshell with double sided tape. The tape can be softened with heat while gently prying with a plastic spludger.
