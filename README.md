# Qingping CGG1 Thermometer Firmware
The goal of this project is reverse engineer and ultimately develop a custom firmware for the [Qingping CGG1](https://www.qingping.co/temp-rh-monitor/overview) bluetooth temperature and humidity sensor. Thanks to [atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441), as his work on the  [ATC_MiThermometer](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer) project inspired me to begin this effort.

## Progress
- See the [wiki](Home) for documentation on the CGG1
