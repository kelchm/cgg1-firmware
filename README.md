# Qingping CGG1 Thermometer Firmware
The goal of this project is reverse engineer and ultimately develop a custom firmware for the [Qingping CGG1](https://www.qingping.co/temp-rh-monitor/overview) (also known as the ClearGrass CGG1 or Xiaomi CGG1) bluetooth temperature and humidity sensor.

Thanks to [atc1441](https://github.com/atc1441), as his work on the  [ATC_MiThermometer](https://github.com/atc1441/ATC_MiThermometer) project inspired me to begin this effort.

## Documentation
See the project [wiki](https://github.com/kelchm/cgg1-thermometer-firmware/wiki) for up to date documentation on the CGG1.
